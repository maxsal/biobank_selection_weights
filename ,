     Perform rapid (parallel) unweighted and weighted (partial)
     correlations on a matrix

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: matrix of variables over which to calculate pairwise
          correlations

    covs: matrix of variables that serve as covariates

covs_alt: alternate matrix of variables that serve as covariates when
          pairwise correlation is not complete

       w: vector of weights

 n_cores: number of cores over which to parallelize

 verbose: logical; report what correlations are being calculate

     data.table of pairwise correlations
